# fuelswitcheroo 2.0

FuelSwitcheroo is an application that allows a user to easily search for alternative fuel stations around the US. They can easily drag a marker or search a location and markers will come up with the information of the fuel station assigned to that marker. The address, fuel type, and distance from the user will appear once the marker is clicked on.
Two APIs were used to complete this, the Mapbox API and the Alternative Fuel Stations API. . Fun Fact: This project began as a RowdyHacks, hosted by UTSA and came out victorious, securing two prizes in the process. It received 2nd place in the learners track and also won recognition for having the most unique domain name.
